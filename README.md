# Prediction of 911 calls for the City of Seattle


# Installation


## Running on GoogleColab

Jupyter Notebook ```theSeattle.ipynb``` was created in GoogleColab and contains (as of latest commit) partially compelted modeling task. 
To run the notebook on GoogleColab, two files must be present in the same directiory as the notebook:

* Seattle 911 calls data that should be downloaded from [here](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Real-Time-Fire-911-Calls/kzjm-xkqj)
* Seattle weather data stored in file: "```Seattle Weatherdata 2002 to 2020.csv```"


## Running on a local machine

Future updates will contain instructions for installation on a local machine.



# The Modeling Task

The goal is to predict the call volume based on the available historical data and weather data. The notebook ```theSeattle.ipynb``` contains both code and detailed discussion on steps taken.

The task is (as of the lastest commit) not yet finished.
